		<p>I grew up just outside Dallas, Texas. I moved to Newark, Delaware in 2006 with my mom when she was offered a job at Hercules. Together my mom and I lived in an apartment in Bear. Often, my dad came up from Texas to visit while my mom was traveling for work. We spent a lot of our time at the Buffalo Wild Wings across the street. I then moved to a townhouse in Newark when I was nine. That's also when I got my first dog, Athena. She is a border collie australian shepherd mix from the Kent County SPCA.</p>
		<p>When I was six, my mom signed me up for cheerleading at the Boys and Girls Club. I also did Girls Scouts through the Boys and Girls Club as well. After cheering there for a couple of years, I joined an all star program where I made and competed on the highest teams. I also coached a younger team as well. In the May of my eighth grade year, I tried out for Padua's cheer team and was one of four freshmen to make varsity. Ever since then, I've loved cheering for Padua. I've won three state championships and a national championship with the team, and I am captain this year.</p>

		<p>I've had two separate jobs. For the summer before junior year, in addition to all of junior year, I worked at Acme as a bagger, cashier, and cake decorator. Now I work at Firebirds in Christiana as a hostess with two other padua girls, Caroline and Becca. I love working there and I'm there normally four times a week. When I grow up I hope to be an economist for the US government in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). <b>I can't wait to graduate!</b></p>
