		<h2 align=center>Welcome to Vik Beach!</h2><!--one of the names of this beach-->
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3 align=center>Risen from the ashes</h3><!--not quite literally ashes-->
				<p align=center> Vik Beach, also known as Reynisfjara, is a beach with BLACK SAND! This comes from the area's history of volcanic activity. 
				Vik is a lava beach where you will find no white sand typical of equatorial destinations. However the sand is not finely ground... it is 
				actually variously sized pebbles formed by lava that instantly cooled upon contact with the water of the ocean. Why go to a white sand beach 
				(that you see all over magazines and your news feed) when you can go see a type of beach that will leave your friends green with envy?</p>

			<h3 align=center>Natural Sculptures!</h3><!--there is actually one human made sculpture too-->
				<p align=center>Facing the ocean are tall basalt columns forming a 
				natural pyramid. It's even been featured in the movie "Noah." Out in the ocean are two tall stone columns named "Reynisdrangar" and are 
				rumored to be trolls that were caught in the sun and petrified. There's also a lighthouse in the vicinity at Dyrh√≥laey, a peninsula formed 
				by lava flow. However, the waves are dangerous and you must be careful because of the possibility of being trapped in the crevices in the
				natural rock formations when the tides rise.</p>

			<h3 align=center>Location, Location, Location!</h3>
				<p align=center>If beaches aren't your thing, then this is the PERFECT beach for you. Nearby, is the quaint fun town by the same name - Vik. 
				You can go there and explore the culture of Iceland as well as the food! Meet locals and see their way of life. Make sure to stop and visit 
				the Flatanger church. And, if you're a fan of golfing, there is great golfing in Vik, Iceland too!</p>

			<h2 align=center>Don't believe us?</h2>
				<q align=center>I first went to Vik when I was a little girl visiting with my family. I was in awe when I first saw the black sand beach! Learning the history 
				and the culture of the area. I have so many good memories from visiting as a child. Now, I bring my whole family so that they can cultivate the same 
				memories and love of Iceland that the trip sparked in me the first time I set eyes on that black sand beach and sea trolls. </q>
